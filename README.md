# Link to live Site: 


## Motivation
Motivation for this project was to help practice my HTML, CSS, and JS skills.
To create a interactive game to share with classmates.

## Game Rules 
First to 5 points wins the game

## Code Style
OOP

## Code Thoughts and Approach

- Player 1 chooses an option 
 - this will be done through adding an event listener to a button. 
 -the click will set the players choice and print it on screen.

- Computer or opponent chooses an option
 - this will be a randomized through math.random
- the function will set the opps choice and print it on screen.

- the options are compared
 -this will be done with if statements


- result is determined from the comparison
 - the results will be printed depending on the if statements.
 -score will be updated depending on if statements. 


- score is checked to see if someone wins the overall game  
  -this will be done with a score variable that changes throughout the game.


- game is over or continues based on score
 -an if statement will helps us view the current score to see if someone has won.

### Problems 

## event.target 
 -I had an issue with making the button return a certain value.
 -I consololed log with the event actually was in order to better understand what I could do.
-I ended up making the code return a specific value depending on the button clicked.
-There may have been a better approach.


## design issues
I wanted to make a live background
