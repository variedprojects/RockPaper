# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS 


## Motivation
Motivation for this project was to help practice my HTML, CSS, and JS skills.
To create a interactive game to share with classmates.

## Code Style
OOP

## Code Thoughts

- Player 1 chooses an option 
 - this will be done through adding an event listener to a button. 
 -the click will set the players choice and print it on screen.

- Computer or opponent chooses an option
 - this will be a randomized through math.random
- the function will set the opps choice and print it on screen.

- the options are compared
 -this will be done with if statements


- result is determined from the comparison
 - the results will be printed depending on the if statements.
 -score will be updated depending on if statements. 


- score is checked to see if someone wins the overall game  
  -this will be done with a score variable that changes throughout the game.


- game is over or continues based on score
 -an if statement will helps us view the current score to see if someone has won.
